            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SportsSim is the creation of software developers Justin Kelly and Samuel Gibson. The motivation for this project is the 
            culmination of several factors: our shared passion for sports (specifically in the NBA) and our immense disappointment when the rest of the NBA season 
            was indefinitely postponed in March 2020.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original idea for this project began in Fall 2019, when we created the first prototype of SportsSim for our senior capstone project. Our goal was to 
                create a website for users to view the huge dataset of player statistics in a clear and accessible way, as we felt that many current NBA stat websites don't have very 
                user-friendly interfaces. We set out to create a simple user interface that even individuals who are just jumping into the game of basketball could understand.
                This project was our first true deep dive into front end development and UI design, and as typical college students, we aimed to produce a sleek home page
                and player page template that would earn us a passing grade without further development of additional pages. After the class, we had little reason to maintain the website until...

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our inspiration to revitalize this project came about in late March, after the NBA season was officially postponed.
                We felt confident that we possessed the know-how needed to generate a simulation of the remaining NBA regular season. As we continued to build our model and the website, 
                we had to decide whether we should also simulate the postseason games. For the most part, regular season games are fairly consistent. 
                Playoff games are a different story, and it's infrequent that one team as a whole would underperform. Sure, some players
                have "off" games during the playoffs for various reasons, but ultimately, playoff basketball is the peak of team competition. We ultimately decided that
                we wanted to take on the challenge of simulating the 2020 NBA postseason based on a more fine-tuned version of our regular season model, and hence the birth of SportsSim.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/swar/nba_api" >NBA_api</a> project as our underlying database, we gathered player, team and 
                matchup data from the last two seasons. 
                Based on machine learning principles, our model predicts the outcome of each game based on multiple factors. An example of these factors include the two teams' previous matchups and both of their 
                relative performance across the season compared to their previous season's performance (with a heavier emphasis on this season).  To be clear, we don't think that this model is perfect. 
                We will be the first to acknowledge that there is a lot more going on on the court than what we can tell purely from statistics, and therefore believe that it is irresponsible
                to weigh a player based solely on their raw statistical output. Given our two-person development team, it was difficult to make an adaptive model that would
                truly reflect what goes on on the basketball court. Our compromise was to create a model that balances theoretical calculations with some human bias to better reflect these nuances.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example of our incorporated biases, we felt that there needed to be a distinguishing factor between a stat line producer like Russell Westbrook
                and an on-court force like Giannis Antetokounmpo, so we assigned weights to both individual players and overall teams. We understand that some fans may not agree
                with our personal biases, so we kindly invite you to create your own model! When we set out to implement these biases into the model, we wanted them to be as fair and accurate as possible,
                and therefore determined the weights based on player/team statistics. Another illustrative example of our weighted bias coming into play in the model is in the case of Stephen Curry, who was injured
                for most of the regular season. As he was only able to play 5 games before the season was indefinitely halted, his shooting percentage statistics were fairly low based on such a small
                sample size. We didn't view these stats as accurately indicative of Curry's explosive shooting capabilites, so we adjusted Curry's bias to take his previous season shooting abilities into account.
